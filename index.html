    <h1>Laila's Poem Assignment</h1>
    <h2><br>The Valentine's Proposal</h2>
    <p>It was the day her beautiful brown eyes became mine</p>
    <p>The day her sparking, glistening eyes locked with mine</p>
    <p>The day I gave her our ring</p>
    <p>Finally after 15 years since I last said goodbye</p>
    <p>She finally looked into my eyes</p>
        <p>The day I no longer heard <em><strong>Goodbye</strong></em></p>
    <p><em>But a whisper</em></p>
    <p>On this very day......</p>
    <p><br><br>"Would you like to continue this dance with me?"</p>
    <p><strong><em>"Yes"</em></strong></p>
