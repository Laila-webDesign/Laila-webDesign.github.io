    <h1>Laila's Poem Assignment</h1>
    <h2><br>The Valentine's Proposal</h2>
    <p>It was the day I saw her</p>
    <p>It was the day her beautiful brown eyes became mine</p>
    <p>The day her sparking glistening eyes locked with mine</p>
    <p>The day I gave her the ring</p>
    <p>Finally after 15 years since I last said goodbye</p>
    <p>She finally looked into my eyes</p>
    <p>The day I no longer heard goodbye</p>
    <p>On this very day......</p>
    <p><br>"Would you like to continue this dance with me?"</p>
